I am a software engineer with over 25 years of active experience with
computers. My journey spans from freelance programming to system administration
in air traffic control. Currently, I work as a senior software engineer at
Visma Labs Slovakia, where I specialize in test-driven development,
event-driven and domain-driven design, hexagonal architecture, and agile methodologies.
